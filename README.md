# Testing of Automated Mouse Tracking with DeepLabCut

This project aims to automatically identify and track the body parts of individual mice in behavioral monitoring videos using DeepLabCut (DLC). The goal is to improve identity labeling and expand behavioral tracking capabilities in semi-naturalistic environments.
this git hold the testing code for the results of DLC and allows for visual inspection of the labeling of individual frames and short video segments 

Additional filles too big for Git are avilable in the following Google drive folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vZ1aHOW9fq2i08cDQ-EZdgl-6R1v-Yq9?usp=drive_link

### Drive folder content:
#### DLC_files folder: 
holds all DLC filles and subfolders from the lab computer, noteable folders inclode:  

the fille "config.yaml" the "heart" of the project that holds and directs all of its spesific information 

"labeled-data" containes the labeled frames from the project's training dataset

"dlc-models" holds information about all versions of the training algorithem ("shuffles")

"evaluation-results" holds evaluations of the training results for shuffles 1, 2 and 5

#### Analyzed_videos folder:
holds examplse of videos used as a dataset in the project and the results of their analysis on the latests version (shuffle5) of the algoritem. can be tested with the collab code 

#### DLC_Results_Processing collab code
the same code as in the Git, for ease of use

#### final project.pdf
a copy of the project's final paper, same as in the Git
