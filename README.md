# Testing of Automated Mouse Tracking with DeepLabCut
##Project Overview
This project aims to automatically identify and track the body parts of individual mice in behavioral monitoring videos using DeepLabCut (DLC). The goal is to improve identity labeling and expand behavioral tracking capabilities in semi-naturalistic environments.
this git hold the testing code for the results of DLC and allows for visual inspection of the labeling of individual frames and short video segments
